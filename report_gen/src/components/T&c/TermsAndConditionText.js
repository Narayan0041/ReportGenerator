                    <p>1.1.
                        FlowCV is an online services platform or all-in-one platform (in short "online services platform") and offers its users at https://flowcv.com, https://flowcv.me, https://flowcv.io, as well as all subdomains, the quick and easy possibility of creating resumes, in each case based on the data provided by the respective user. FlowCV is operated by UNIQKORN Creative GmbH, FN 442984 y, Lindauergasse 23, 1230 Vienna, Austria (in short "UNIQKORN").

                        1.2.
                        The aim of FlowCV is to enable its users, through the use of user-friendly applications and services, as well as through careful use of artificial intelligence (hereinafter "AI"), to create online and easily a modern and visually appealing resume (also "CV" or "curriculum vitae").

                        1.3.
                        In addition to creating resumes, FlowCV offers its users the ability to create cover letters, use application trackers, design personal websites, and create email signatures.

                        The digital works created by the user through FlowCV's services depend significantly on the information provided by the user and the use of FlowCV's available services, and it is the sole responsibility of each user to use the created works accordingly. UNIQKORN therefore assumes no warranty that the works created by users through FlowCV will meet the expectations of users, for example in connection with an application process. Users decide independently and on their own responsibility whether and if so how they use the works created via FlowCV and whether they use them, for example in application processes.
                        <br /><br />
                        1.6.
